## üîÑ Pre-Deployment Tasks (Manual)

### Database Setup
- [ ] Set up production MongoDB database (MongoDB Atlas recommended)
- [ ] Configure database user with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Test database connectivity
- [ ] Run admin seeding: `npm run seed-admin:production`

### Environment Variables
- [ ] Generate secure NEXTAUTH_SECRET: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- [ ] Set production MONGODB_URI
- [ ] Configure NEXTAUTH_URL with production domain
- [ ] Set up email service (Resend API key)
- [ ] Configure any optional services (analytics, monitoring)

### Security Review
- [ ] Verify all secrets are properly set
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Validate admin permissions
- [ ] Review and test all API endpoints

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Run production build: `npm run build:production`
- [ ] Test with production database
- [ ] Load testing with realistic traffic
- [ ] Mobile performance testing

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Configure application monitoring (optional)
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Configure error alerting
- [ ] Set up log aggregation

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:vercel
```

### Option 2: Docker
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Option 3: Traditional Server
```bash
# Build and start with PM2
npm run build:production
pm2 start npm --name "dinar-exchange" -- run start:production
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
```bash
# Run health check
npm run health-check

# Test critical endpoints
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health
curl https://yourdomain.com/admin/login
```

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Admin login works
- [ ] User registration/login works
- [ ] Order creation and management
- [ ] Email notifications
- [ ] File uploads (if applicable)
- [ ] Database operations

### Performance Verification
- [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds
- [ ] API response times < 500ms
- [ ] Image optimization working
- [ ] Caching headers present

### Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] Security headers present
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code
- [ ] Authentication working properly
- [ ] CSRF protection active

## üìä Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor application logs
- [ ] Check database performance
- [ ] Review security alerts
- [ ] Update dependencies regularly
- [ ] Backup database regularly

### Emergency Procedures
- [ ] Document rollback procedure
- [ ] Have emergency contacts ready
- [ ] Know how to scale resources
- [ ] Have database backup/restore process

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**: Clear `.next` cache and rebuild
2. **Database Connection**: Verify MONGODB_URI and network access
3. **Authentication Issues**: Check NEXTAUTH_SECRET and URL settings
4. **Performance Issues**: Review bundle size and optimize images
